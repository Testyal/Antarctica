Why do you want to travel to Antarctica and what excites you about this expedition?

So during my last few months at uni this year (when exam season was in full swing), I spent a lot of my time going on long walks. Invariably, these walks would lead me past a small lake where a large community of geese made their home. Among them were three families of goslings, meaning I pretty much spent all of my time which I could've used for revision instead watching these babies grow up from newly hatched to almost fledged, which I've chronicled here: https://www.instagram.com/billybart96/.

Every day spent with these geese gave me more apprecation for them and how they acted as a collective, which helped me appreciate completely different species of birds. Coming home, I've been paying attention to the birds around my area (sparrows, swans, robins, pigeons, corvids) ten times as much as before, providing food where necessary and caring for an injured pigeon. Consequently, my awareness of birds across the world and the ecosystems they live in has been at the front of my mind more than ever before. Research from the past decades indicated humans have had an impact on all continents of the earth. Antarctica is the most isolated from human impact of them all, and only recently have we started to pay attention to waste making its way to the Antarctic coast and in the surrounding ocean. While I'd love to see a penguin colony, it's probably not going to happen. But knowing that the work we would do could protect them from human impact would be rewarding on its own! 

Having recently graduated without a clear plan for my future, I've spent much of my summer thinking about where I could go, and learning new things. When I received the email for the Antarctic sabbatical from Airbnb, it was an instant decision. This opportunity would be a perfect way for me to...

To support my application, most of my time over the past week I've been doing a couple of things. First, I've been using what I've learned about programming and game development over summer to start working on a small game where you play as a penguin sliding between research stations across the Antarctic, collecting as many ice cores as possible along the way. My hope is that once our expedition is over and we have data from the ice, I can put in the the data from each ice core, as well as our journey across the Antarctic (maybe taking some creative liberties with the distances!)

Second, I've been using my access to scientific journals to find out about previous research on human impact in the Antarctic. From this, I've learned about microplastics in cosmetics, waste in the sea around research stations, and how macroplastics degrade into microplastics. Interestingly, everything I've found about the impact on land has been in the intertidal region. Data coming from the interior of the Antarctic...

I've put both the penguin game and my research here: [PUT GITHUB LINK] - check them out if you can! It's very likely I'll update this to reflect what I learn over the next few weeks, since this is the most motivated and excited I've been about an opportunity for a long time, besides the motivation I had for the goslings, of course!
