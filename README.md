# Penguin Game

After learning about a program offering a trip to Antarctica, this project was made using what the author was experimenting with at the time (Unity) to make something entirely unique for their application. This resulted in a small game where you control a penguin sliding across Antarctica. The hope was that if the application was successful, the game would be filled up with a summary of the trip.

The quality of the code (uh, bad) and the art (uhh, really bad) is a product of the timeframe there was available to develop it - about 1~2 weeks. That being said, it's still fun to play about and see how far you can get the penguin to jump!

The Windows executable is available at `Penguin Game/bin/penguin-game/Penguin Game.exe`
